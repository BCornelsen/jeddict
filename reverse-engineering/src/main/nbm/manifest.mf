OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description: Jeddict supports reverse engineering by importing existing source code and create new ER diagrams. \
    Visualize JPA classes & database models so you can see how elements such as attributes, relationships and other objects relate to each other without showing actual data. \
    Working with legacy database becomes even more challenging when the documentation has been lost in time. \
    Make it available again by importing the existing database and create new ER diagram. \
    Visually study the table structures and their relationships.
